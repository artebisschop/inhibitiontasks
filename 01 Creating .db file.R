In the congruent condition, the green circle appears on the left of the screen and the red circle on right side of the screen, whereas in the incongruent condition, the side associated with the presented color is in contrast with the side on which the circle is represented.",

In congruent conditions the target and distracting characters match and are both are vowels or consonants (e.g., “AAAEAAA”), whereas in incongruent conditions the target and distracting characters mismatch (e.g., “SSSESSS”)."))
